Hi, Adam,
 
Can you add these items to the Calvary Comics website?  A link for the "Unshackled!" booklet to go just under the link for SADHU SUNDAR SINGH, and the cover and opening five pages of the "Unshackled!" booklet.  Then, under the ordering information, I'd like it to read:
 
"Unshackled!" comics booklet, 3" x 5", fifteen black-and-white comics pages plus cover art, saddlestitched.  50 cents each.  1-9 copies, 50 cents postage; 10-19 copies, $2 postage; 20 or more copies, $3 postage.  If you can put this on the same PayPal button as the SINGH graphic novel, great.  If not, let me know, and I'll ask a friend who has PayPal on his site for many differently priced items to give us advice on how to do so.  
 
Eventually, I want to add GLORY TO GOD #2 to the site as well, and to offer it for sale also.  
 
Thanks again for your help!
